### App Idea

DailyMark is an app designed to monitor daily routines, enabling users to establish tasks within a desired weekly routine. It records the time invested in cultivating specific habits. Progress can be recorded and stored using the app's timer or through manual time logs. The application provides a visual representation of habit streaks within a week, utilizing a pie chart to illustrate habit distribution for a routine and a bar or area chart to showcase the instances when habit goals were achieved throughout the week for a specific routine. The app will allow users to create and manage multiple routines to accommodate various aspects of their life, such as work, fitness, and personal development, any area in particular they wish to build habits in.

## Notes

No roadblocks encountered while building the app.
